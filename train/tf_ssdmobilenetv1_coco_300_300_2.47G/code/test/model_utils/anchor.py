  This op creates a set of anchor boxes by placing a "basis" collection of

  distributed points along a grid.  The basis collection is specified via the
  scale and aspect_ratios arguments.  For example, setting scales=[.1, .2, .2]

  .1, aspect ratio 2, one with scale .2, aspect ratio 2, and one with scale .2
  and aspect ratio 1/2.  Each box is multiplied by "base_anchor_size" before
  placing it over its respective center.

  the anchor_stride and anchor_offset parameters.

    grid_height: size of the grid in the y direction (int or int scalar tensor)
    grid_width: size of the grid in the x direction (int or int scalar tensor)
